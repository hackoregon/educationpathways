            <h4>High School Grads</h4>
            <p>In May 2015, Oregonians woke up to an alarming headline: “<a href="http://www.kgw.com/story/news/education/2015/05/13/report-oregon-graduation-rates-holding-us-back-from-goal/27270597/">Oregon has Worst Graduation Rate in US.</a>” It <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2015/01/oregon_posts_worst_graduation.html">provoked</a> a mix of outrage, embarrassment, and resignation, and raised serious questions about why so many young people were not making it through high school and what was being done about it.</p>
            <div id="storyoneexpanded" class="collapse story-collapse">
              <p>Gerald Scrutchions is an <a href="http://www.avid.org/avid-college-readiness-system.ashx">AVID</a> (Advancement Via Individual Determination) instructor and social studies teacher at <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/roosevelt/">Roosevelt High School</a>. AVID is a college preparatory program offered at 15 schools in the Portland Public Schools district.</p>
              <p>“It’s about culture,” explains Gerald, now in his second year at Roosevelt, “we’re trying – schoolwide – to teach the skills students need to be college and career ready so they have good options available to them when they graduate.” The skills training – emphasizing writing, inquiry, critical reading, collaboration, and organization – are complemented by hands-on college and financial-aid research and field trips to colleges, universities, and workplaces. “It emphasizes purpose…and learning in ways that build proficiency over time.”</p>
              <p>We know these things do create pathways to enrollment in college or career training. AVID has an enviable success rate nationally, and in Portland, the first high school class to have completed the program in 2014 (Madison High School) reported a <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/departments/curriculum/2433.htm">100% graduation rate</a>.</p>
              <p>But a lot can get in the way: the AVID approach may not be reinforced at home and poverty, parenthood, and competing priorities – including sports – can undermine both teacher and student efforts. Programs like AVID may not be enough.</p>
              <p>When we asked Gerald to name one thing that we had not yet discussed that had the potential to really help his students thrive, he replied immediately and with passion.</p>
              <p>“Food health.”</p>
              <p>That’s when things got really interesting.</p>
              <p>“Roosevelt students depend on the school as a source of nutrition – nearly 100% qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch. What we offer is just not good enough,” lamented Gerald. “So they don’t eat it, they go to McDonald’s or eat from snack carts.”</p>
              <p>“We see kids eating hot fries for breakfast and then falling asleep at 10 in the morning.”</p>
              <p>Gerald argued that <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/bond/">school modernization</a> – a <a href="http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/213404-71878-group-says-pps-fumbles-roosevelt-hs-modernization">controversial process</a> Roosevelt is in the middle of – should include improving food services for students. “We have these amazing food carts all over the city that offer better, healthier options, and could generate interest in food systems, culinary careers, or entrepreneurship – even science in the context of the new STEM [Science Technology Engineering, and Math] lab.”</p>
              <p>Gerald is spearheading a team to find ways to repurpose what is slated to be a fenced-in, sod-covered patch under the modernization plan, and turn it into raised beds – in the short term so that students can anticipate and help design the opportunities this might create. Portland maintains at least <a href="http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/nutrition/PPS_Edible-Gardens_4-2010.pdf">40 public school community gardens</a>, but all are located at elementary schools.</p>
              <p>“A lot of our problems would be solved if we just figured out better ways to feed our kids. And growing things, good food – this is part of Oregon’s heritage.”</p>
              <p>Growing food could also make STEM(s) very real.</p>
